to improve it lets apply this:
Best Practices for Next.js Auth with Zustand:
Secure Token Storage:
If using JWTs, store them in secure, HTTP-only cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript access and mitigate XSS attacks.
Middleware for Protected Routes:
Use Next.js middleware to protect routes and redirect unauthenticated users to a login page.
Data Access Layer for Authorization:
Implement authorization logic within your data fetching functions, especially when working with server components, to ensure data is only accessed by authorized users.
Error Handling and UI Feedback:
Provide clear error messages and UI feedback during authentication processes.
